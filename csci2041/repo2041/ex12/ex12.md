# Exercise Set 12: References, Side-Effects, and Mutability

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Spring 2019 (Hopper)*

**Due:** Monday, April 22 at 11:59pm

## 1.  Types and evaluations: references

In your terminal, change directory to the `ex12` directory within your personal class repository, and create a file with the name `refeval.md` to record your answers to this problem.  Remember to run `git add refeval.md` before you commit.

For each of the following expressions, indicate the type and value of the expression.  Assume there are no bindings preceding these expressions, that is, treat each expression as an independent OCaml program.  

1. ``let a = ref [] in a := 7::(!a)``

2. ``let b = ref [] in b := [1] ; b := [] ; !b``

3. ``let a = ref "hello" in let b = a in b := "world" ; !a``

4. 
```
   let double s = s := (!s)^(!s) in
   let s1 = ref "hi" in
   let s2 = s1 in double s1; s2
   ```

5. 
```
   let x = ref 0 in
   let y = ref [0;1;1;2;3;5;8] in
   let rec f () = match !y with
   | [] -> !x
   | h::t -> x := !x+h; y := t; f () in
   f ()
   ```

6. 
```
   let p = ref 1 in
   let rec mnz = function [] -> p
   | 0::t -> mnz t
   | h::t -> p := h*(!p); mnz t
   in mnz
   ```

7. ``let f x = x := 2.0 ** !x in let z = ref 4.0 in f z ; !z``

### Answer format and test cases
Your solution file should consist of a markdown ordered list, where each list item has a line of the form `type: t` followed by a line of the form `value: v`, e.g.
```
1. type: unit
value: ()
```
If the result of the expression is a function value, you should explain what the function does after `value:`.
To get full credit for this section, you must correctly answer at least 6/7 of the questions.

## 2.  Types and evaluations: other mutable types

In a second file named 'mutable_eval.md', record the type and value of each of the following expressions, some of which reference the following record type definitions:
```
type 'a p1 = { mutable fst1 : 'a ; mutable snd1 : 'a }
type 'a p2 = { fst2 : 'a ref ; snd2 : 'a ref }
```

1. ``let a1 = {fst1 = Bytes.of_string "apples"; snd1 = Bytes.of_string "bananas"} in a1.snd1 <- a1.fst1 ; Bytes.set a1.snd1 0 'e' ; a1.fst1``

2. ``[|"twinkle"; "twinkle"; "little"; "star"|].(3) <- "car"``

3. ``let x1 = {fst1 = 1; snd1 = 2} in let x2 = x1.fst1 in x1.fst1 <- 3 ; x1.fst1 = x2``

4. ``let y1 = {fst2 = ref 1; snd2 = ref 2} in let y2 = y1.fst2 in y1.fst2 := 3; !(y1.fst2) = !y2``

5. ``let s = Bytes.of_string "thequickbrownfoxsomething" in Bytes.set s 5 'a' ; s``

6. 
```
let a1 = {fst1 = "a"; snd1 = "b"} in
let a2 = {fst2 = ref "a"; snd2 = ref "b" } in
let a3 = {fst1 = a1.fst1 ; snd1 = a1.snd1 } in
let a4 = {fst2 = a2.fst2 ; snd2 = a2.snd2 } in a1.fst1 <- "c" ; a2.fst2 := "c"; a3.fst1 = !(a4.fst2)
```

7. ``let z1 = {fst1 = "pumpkin" ; snd1 = "pie"} in let z2 = z1 in z2.fst1 <- "apple" ; z1.fst1``

8. ``let u = [|1;2;3|] in let v = [|1;2;3|] in u==v``

### Test cases
Your solution file should consist of a markdown ordered list, where each list item has a line of the form `type: t` followed by a line of the form `value: v`, e.g.
```
1. type: string
value: ...
```
If the result of the expression is a function value, you should explain what the function does after `value:`.

## 3. Mutable data structures

### Array functions

Let's write some of our favorite `List` functions for `Arrays` in the file `list_arr.ml`:

+ `rev_array : 'a array -> unit` should reverse an array in place, so the result of

    * `let a = [|1; 2; 3 |] in rev_array a; a` should be `[|3; 2; 1|]`, and

    * `let b = [||] in rev_array b; b` should be `[||]` and

    * `let c = [|"sweet"; "potatoes"|] in rev_array c; c` should be `[|"potatoes"; "sweet"|]`

+ `zip_array : 'a array -> 'b array -> ('a*'b) array` should take two arrays of equal length, and zip them into pairs, e.g.

    * `zip_array [|1;2|] [|"a";"b"|]` should evaluate to `[|(1, "a"); (2, "b")|]`

    * `zip_array [|true; false; true|] [|0;1;1|]` should evaluate to `[|(true, 0); (false, 1); (true, 1)|]`

### Mutable list functions

Here's a definition for the type `'a mlist`, an OCaml version of the standard mutable linked list data type, which is also in the file `mlist.ml`:
```
type 'a ll = { mutable hd : 'a ; mutable tl : 'a mlist}
 and 'a mlist = List of 'a ll | Nil
```
Let's write some functions in `mlist.ml` to handle mutable linked lists:

+ `mlist_of_list : 'a list -> 'a mlist` takes an immutable list as an argument and returns a mutable list with the same contents, so
    * `mlist_of_list []` should evaluate to `Nil`

    * `mlist_of_list [1;2;3]` should evaluate to
      `List {hd = 1; tl = List {hd = 2; tl = List {hd = 3; tl = Nil}}}`

+ `rev_mlst : 'a mlist -> 'a mlist` should destructively reverse its argument, so that the returned list uses the same cells as the input list, and:

    * `rev_mlist Nil` should evaluate to `Nil`

    * `rev_mlist (List {hd = 1; tl = List {hd = 2; tl = Nil}})` should evaluate to `List {hd = 2; tl = List {hd = 1; tl = Nil}}`

+ `append_m : 'a mlist -> 'a mlist -> 'a mlist` should destructively append its second argument to the end of its first argument and return the result, so

    * `append_m (List {hd = "mashed"; tl = List {hd = "potatoes"; tl = Nil}})
      (List {hd = "gravy"; tl = Nil})` should evaluate to
      `List {hd = "mashed"; tl = List {hd = "potatoes"; tl = List {hd = "gravy"; tl= Nil}}}`

    * ``let l1 = List {hd = 1; tl = Nil} in
       let l2 = append_m l1 (List {hd = 2; tl = Nil}) in l1 = l2`` should evaluate to `true`

### Test cases

There are 11 total test cases, and to get full credit for this section your solution should pass at least 9/11.
