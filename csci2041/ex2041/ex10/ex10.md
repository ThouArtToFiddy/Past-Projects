# Exercise Set 10: Structural Induction

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Spring 2019 (Hopper)*

**Due:** Monday, April 8 at 11:59pm

## 1.  Induction Principles for other types

For each inductively-defined data type below, what is the principle of structural induction for elements of the given type?  Your answer should be recorded in the file `ex10/indprins.md` in the form:

```
## `type example = C0 | C1 of example | C2 of example*example`

  forall m : t. P(t) if
  + P(C0)
  + forall m. P(m) => P(C1(m))
  + forall m1, m2. P(m1) && P(m2) => P(C2(m1,m2))
```

Note that there should be a separate case for each constructor of the given data type.

i. `type 'a btree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a btree  * 'a btree`

ii. `type 'a ttree = EmptyT | Leaf of 'a | TNode of 'a ttree * 'a ttree * 'a ttree`

iii. `type bexpr = True | False | Var | Not of bexpr | And of bexpr * bexpr | Or of bexpr * bexpr`

iv. `type 'a nested = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a nested | Nest of 'a nested * 'a nested`

v. `type islist = End | I of int * islist | S of string * islist`

### Test cases

The gitbot will attempt to match proof cases in the order they appear in the type declaration.  There is one test case for each type, and you should pass 3/5 cases to get full credit for this problem.

## 2.  List induction proofs

This question uses the following function definitions on lists:

```ocaml
let rec length = function
| [] -> 0
| _::t -> 1+(length t)

let rec sum = function
| [] -> 0
| h::t -> h+(sum t)

let rec mem x = function
| [] -> false
| h::t -> (x=h) || (mem x t)

let rec append l1 l2 = match l1 with
| [] -> l2
| h::t -> h::(append t l2)

let shift_right l =
  let rec shr l t = match l with
  | [] -> t
  | x::[] -> x::t
  | x::xs -> shr xs (append t [x])
  in shr l []
```

Let's prove the following identities by structural induction on lists:

+ `length (append l1 l2) = (length l1) + (length l2)`

+ `mem x (append l1 l2) = (mem x l1) || (mem x l2)`

+ `length (shift_right l) = (length l)`

+ `sum (shift_right l) = sum l`


### Answer format and test cases

Your solutions for this section should go in the file `ex10/list.md` following the format in the copy of this file appearing in the public `ex2041-s19` repo. The gitbot will examine your proofs for required sections (e.g., the theorem statement, base case section, inductive case section, and the inductive hypothesis). Try to complete 2 of the 4 questions in this section.  **Note: your assessment grade will be determined by a human grader; "passing" the feedback tests does not mean your answer is correct**

## 3.  Induction on other types

### trees

```ocaml
type 'a btree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a btree * 'a btree

let rec stree t v = match t with
| Empty -> false
| Node(u,lt,rt) ->  (u=v) || (stree lt v) || (stree rt v)

let rec mirror t = match t with
| Empty -> Empty
| Node(v,lt,rt) -> Node(v,mirror rt, mirror lt)

let rec size t = match t with
| Empty -> 0
| Node(_,lt,rt) -> 1 + (size lt) + (size rt)
```

Prove the following identities on elements of `'a btree`:

+ `size t = size (mirror t)`

+ `stree t v = stree (mirror t) v`

### `bexpr`

```ocaml
type bexpr = True | False | Var | Not of bexpr | And of bexpr * bexpr | Or of bexpr * bexpr

let rec has_var bx = match bx with
| True | False -> false
| Var -> true
| Not (b) -> has_var b
| And (b1,b2) | Or (b1,b2) -> (has_var b1) || (has_var b2)

type mm = T | F | Maybe
let rec eval bx = match bx with
| Var -> Maybe
| True -> T | False -> F
| Not (b) -> (match (eval b) with T -> F | F -> T | Maybe -> Maybe)
| And(b1,b2) -> (match (eval b1, eval b2) with
  | (_,F) | (F,_) -> F
  | (T,T) -> T
  | _ -> Maybe)
| Or(b1,b2) -> match (eval b1, eval b2) with
  | (_,T) | (T,_) -> F
  | (T,T) -> T
  | _ -> Maybe
```

Prove that for all `bx : bexpr`, `eval bx = Maybe` &rArr; `has_var bx = true`

### nested

```ocaml
type 'a nested = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a nested | Nest of 'a nested * 'a nested


let rec nmem x nl = match nl with
| Nil -> false
| Cons (y,t) -> (y=x) || (nmem x t)
| Nest (nst,rst) -> (nmem x nst) || (nmem x rst)

let rec flatten nl = match nl with
| Nil -> []
| Cons(a, nl) -> a::(flatten nl)
| Nest(n1,nlrest) -> (flatten n1) @ (flatten nlrest)
```

Prove that:

+ `nmem x nl = mem x (flatten nl)`

### Test cases

Put your solution in the file named `ex10/struct.md` Unfortunately, performing automated grading of induction proofs without teaching a separate class on automated theorem-proving tools is not feasible. Thus the gitbot will only check that your solutions have the required components.  You should attempt at least 3 proofs in this section.  **Note: your assessment grade will be determined by a human grader; "passing" the feedback tests does not mean your answer is correct**
