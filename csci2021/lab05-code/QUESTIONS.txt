Answer the questions below according to the lab specification. Write
your answers directly in this text file and submit it to complete the
lab.


PROBLEM 1: ipow Assembly
========================

  The code pack contains the following files.
  - ipow_for.c : ipow function using a for loop
  - ipow_while.c : ipow function using a while loop
  - ipow_main.c : main function to call the above
  Both the for and while versions define the same function which has a
  meaning which should be obvious.

  Compile and run these as programs using either of the below:
  ,----
  | > gcc ipow_main.c ipow_for.c
  | > ./a.out 3 5
  | 3^5 = 243
  | OR
  | > gcc ipow_main.c ipow_while.c
  | > ./a.out 3 5
  | 3^5 = 243
  `----


A
~

  Compile ipow_for.c to assembly code. Look up how to do this with gcc
  if you did not take notes on how to do so from lecture. Make sure to
  disable optimizations by gcc when compiling.

  Paste the command you used and the generated assembly for the
  resulting ipow_for.s as you answer below.

  gcc -S ipow_for


B
~

  Similarly, compile the file ipow_while.c to assembly and compare the
  resulting ipow_while.s to ipow_for.s.
  - If you see differences, describe what these differences are and why
    the generated code varies between the two.
  - If you see similar code, describe why this might be.

  gcc -S ipow_while

  The code looks exactly the same, with the exception of their names.
  It looks the same because they are functionally the same at the compiler level, which turns it into the same assembly code

C
~

  Examine the generated assembly code in ipow_for.s carefully. Based on
  the "assignments" of initial values to registers and the use of
  registers in operations like multiplication, addition, and comparison,
  attempt to draw a correspondence between the assembly registers and C
  variables. Ensure you identify the C variables
  - argument base: which register contains the 1st function argument?
  - argument exp: which register contains the 2nd function argument?
  - local pow which is also the return value
  - local i

  For your answer, paste in an annotated copy of the ipow_for.s which
  shows labels the correspondence of registers to C variables and
  describes how most of the assembly lines correspond to lines in the C
  code. You may skip lines like
  ,----
  | .cfi_startproc
  | .type	ipow, @function
  | .size	ipow, .-ipow
  | .ident	"GCC: (GNU) 7.3.0"
  | .section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
  `----
  which are assembler directives beyond the scope of our current
  interest.

  movl	$0, %edx i is set to 0
	movl	$1, %eax pow is set to 1
	jmp	.L2
.L3:
	imull	%edi, %eax base is multiplied with pow
	addl	$1, %edx
.L2:
	cmpl	%esi, %edx exp is compared with i
	jl	.L3
	rep ret

D
  ~

  One oddity that is likely to appear in the generated assembly code is
  the instruction
  ,----
  | rep ret
  `----
  The `ret' instruction is a function return but `rep' is supposed to
  have a different purpose and the combination is strange.  Investigate
  this by
  - Reading page 208 of Bryant/O'Hallaron which describes this in an
    "aside" , OR
  - Doing a little internet search which should yield similar
    information.
  Describe roughly why `rep ret' shows up here.

  The rep stops incorrect jumping to the ret line

PROBLEM 2: Binary Analysis
==========================

  The two files verify_main.c and verify.o can be compiled together to
  form an executable as in the following.
  ,----
  | > gcc verify.o verify_main.c
  | > ./a.out
  | Complete this sentence by C creator Dennis Ritchie:
  | C has the power of assembly language and the convenience of ...
  | pizza?
  | Have a nice tall glass of ... NOPE.
  | >
  `----

  The intent of the executable is to enter the correct string to
  complete a sentence.  Unfortunately the source code for the verify()
  function in verify.o has been lost.  This problem analyzes how one
  might determine the correct answer without source code.


A: strings utility for binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Make use of the `strings' program which is available on most Unix
  platforms. This program shows the ASCII strings present in a binary
  object such as verify.o. Run it by typing:
  ,----
  | > strings verify.o
  `----
  Show the results you of the run for you answer and speculate about
  what strings seem probable as completions to the sentence in
  verify_main.

B: nm utility to show symbol names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Run the `nm' utility which is short for "names". It produces the set
  of symbols present in a binary file.
  ,----
  | > nm verify.o
  `----
  Such symbols are identified by 1-letter codes such as
  - T/t : program instructions (text) in the object
  - D/d : data defined in the objects
  - U : undefined symbols in the object which must come from other
    objects

  Show the output of you run of `nm' and speculate on what variable
  might contain the completion to the sentences.

C: GDB with Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The binary utilities mentioned can give some insight and perhaps
  enable problems like this to be "brute forced": once all possible
  answers are known, try all of them until something works.

  However, `gdb' can provide a faster route as it handles assembly code
  as easily as C code.  Take the following approach.

  1. Run gdb on the executable resulting from compiling verify_main.c
     and verify.o
  2. In TUI mode, use the command
     ,----
     | (gdb) layout asm
     `----
     to show assembly code for the program being debugged. This is
     necessary when dealing with binary files like verify.o.  If you
     neglected to run `gdb' in TUI mode, you can enable it with
     ,----
     | (gdb) tui enable
     `----
  3. Set a breakpoint on the function that verifies the input.
  4. Run the program to the breakpoint. You will need to enter a guess
     for the sentence completion but anything will work to move the
     program forward.
  5. Once the verifying function is entered, look for a string
     comparison to be done, likely using the `strcmp()' function.  Step
     forwards to just before this function. Use the `stepi' instruction
     to step forward by single assembly instructions.
  6. Immediately preceding this call will be some movement of pointers
     into registers which are the arguments to the function. You should
     inspect the strings pointed to by these registers.
  7. You can print the values of registers as various things in `gdb'
     using the `print' command and C-style casting. Examples are below.
     Note register names are preceded with a dollar sign ($).
     ,----
     |    (gdb) print (int) $rax
     |    $1 = -8448
     |    (gdb) print (char *) $rax
     |    $2 = 0x7fffffffdf00 "cruft\n"
     |    (gdb) print (double) $rax
     |    $3 = 140737488346880
     |    (gdb) print (int *) $rax
     |    $4 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdf00
     `----
  8. Look particularly at "argument" registers which are used to pass
     information to functions like `strcmp()'.  Some of these should
     contain pointers to the string entered and the correct string.

  Give the correct string to enter to complete the sentence.
