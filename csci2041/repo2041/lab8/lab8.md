# Lab 8: Lazy Evaluation and Streams

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Spring 2019 (Hopper)*

**Due:** Thursday, March 28 at 11:59pm.

## Ground rules

You may choose to work alone or with a partner on this lab. If you choose to work in a group, follow these [group instructions](group-instructions.md) to set up a group repository, and use that repository to store your work in this lab.

Although labs are meant to be an open and collaborative environment, it is the
responsibility of all partners to contribute to learning the materials in every
lab. In particular, all partners are responsible for ensuring that submissions
are received by the due date.

As will be the case for all labs this semester, your work should appear in a directory called `lab8` of your personal or group repository.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to do a `git pull` in the public `labs2041-s19` repository to get the lab files, then do a recursive copy to copy the entire `lab8` folder into the destination repository:

```
% cd ~/csci2041/labs2041-s19
% git pull
% cd ..
% cp -R labs2041-s19/lab8 repo-dest1234/
% cd repo-dest1234/
% git add lab8
```

# Introduction: Goals for this lab

+ Practice with lazy evaluation

+ See an example of defining a stream generator

+ Get some experience writing stream and lazylist functions

## Answering the questions in this lab

Create a `lab8` directory in your team repository, and copy the files
`lab8/lazylabval.md` and `lab8/lab8streams.ml` to this directory.

## Lazy Evaluation
Consider the following function definitions, in _`lazyCaml`_ (same
syntax as OCaml, but using lazy evaluation):

```
type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | EmptyT | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

let rec crazytree n v = if n = 0 then (Leaf v) else
	Node(crazytree (n-1) ("a"^v), crazytree n ("buffalo"^v))

let rec treefind t v = match t with
| EmptyT -> False
| Leaf v' -> v'=v
| Node(l,r) -> (treefind l v) || (treefind r v)
```

The file `lazylabval.md` contains two _`lazyCaml`_ expressions using these
definitions.  For each expression, state whether the expression evaluates to a
normal form in a finite number of steps (Normal Form), or the expression will
never reach a normal form (Never) under lazy evaluation.  For those expressions
that will reach a normal form, give the resulting value on the following line.
You should attempt to explain your reasoning on the following line.


## Streams and Lazy lists

In class we presented the data structures `'a stream` and `'a
lazylist` as ways to represent possibly infinite data structure within
the eager evaluation order of OCaml.  The file `lab8streams.ml` has
definitions for these data types and the utility functions `take_s`
and `lz_take` to be used in completing this lab.  Now add four
function definitions to this file:

+ `ustring_s : string -> string stream` takes a string `s` as input and
  generates the list of all strings that are 0 or more concatenations
  of `s` with itself.  Example evaluations: `take_s 3 (ustring_s
  "yo")` should evaluate to `[""; "yo"; "yoyo"]` and `take_s 4
  (ustring_s "boo")` should evaluate to
  `[""; "boo"; "booboo"; "boobooboo"]`.

+ `lz_ustring : string -> string lazylist` generates a `string
	  lazylist` with the same elements as `ustring`. So `lztake 3 (lz_ustring "ho")` should evaluate to `[""; "ho": "hoho"]`

+ `take_until_s : 'a stream -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a list` takes a stream
  and a predicate, and evaluates the predicate on each element of the
  stream until the predicate returns true, returning a list of all of
  the items before this element.   For example `take_until_s
  (ustring_s "a") (fun s -> String.length s = 4)` should evaluate to
  `["";"a";"aa";"aaa"]`

+ `lz_take_until: 'a lazylist -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a list` performs the
  same function as `take_until` with a lazy list instead of a string,
	So `lz_take_until (lz_ustring "om") (fun s -> s = "omom")` should evaluate to `["";"om"]`. Make sure to watch out for the `End` case that is not present in
  streams: `lz_take_until End (fun s -> false)` should evaluate to `[]`.


# Commit and push so that everything is up on GitHub

Now you need to just turn in your work. Commit your `lab8streams.ml`
and `lazylabval.md` files and push them up to your central GitHub repository.

Verify that this worked, by using your browser to see the changes on
https://github.umn.edu.

If you do not properly push your changes to the repository we
cannot give you credit for the lab, so please remember to do this
step!

__This concludes lab 8.__

**Due:** Thursday, March 28 at 11:59pm.

Note that any required changes must exist in your repository on
github.umn.edu. Doing the work but failing to push those changes
to your central repository will mean that we cannot see your work
and hence can't grade it.
