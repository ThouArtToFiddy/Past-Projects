Write the step-by-step lazy evaluation of each of the following _`lazyCaml`_ expressions; or if the expression does not terminate with a normal form, state why:

1. `treefind (crazytree 1 "?") "abuffalo?"`
Normal Form
true
will take the string created by crazytree which is abuffalo? and compare with "abuffalo"

2. `treefind (crazytree 1 "!") "buffalobuffalo!"`
Never
will not be equal
